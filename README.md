## Overview of Project

The purpose of the analysis was developing Dana's webpage with a dynamic table, where users could be allowed to filter 
for multiple criteria like city, state, country and shape at the same time.

## Results

The webpage is developed with a dynamic table, where multiple filters can be applied. As shown in the images below, 
the more filters applied during search, the more criteria is included, and the results are narrowed accordingly.

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is that it is upper/lower case-sensitive. In this case, when the search is made 
using an upper case instead of a lower case, the search results will be blank as shown in the image.

For further development, below can be applied on the code:
- The code can be updated as case-insensitive. 
- A dynamic calendar which could make date selection easier for the user can be included in the code.
